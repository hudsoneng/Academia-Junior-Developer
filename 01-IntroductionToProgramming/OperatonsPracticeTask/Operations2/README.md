### Operations2

Small C# console exercise from my Junior Developer Academy journey.

#### Summary
The app receives two numbers and returns which division produces the higher result (`a / b` vs `b / a`).

#### Tech
- C# / .NET Console App

#### How to run
1. Open the project folder
2. Run:
   - `Run Console Debug`

#### Notes
- Current version uses hardcoded values (will be updated to read user input).
